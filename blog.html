          <h2 class="blog-title">Christmas in lockdown - December 2020</h2>
          <p>
            For a brass band music is a group and social activity both for our
            players and also for our audiences - so it took us a little while to
            try to work out how we could keep our players engaged under the
            current restrictions. But we've done it!
          </p>
          <p>
            We started off with a regular quiz Zoom night on a music theme - but
            that ran out of steam after a month or two, and the Covid-19
            situation extended longer than any of us initially expected. So we
            started doing what we do best - playing music. We issued music to
            our players, and we were tasked with rehearsing our individual
            parts. Then we recorded our parts and sent them to one of our
            members who mixed the individual parts into one piece of music. It
            was a learning experience for us all, but at least we were active!
          </p>
          <p>
            These initial practices stood us in good stead as we then
            volunteered to take part in the Welsh National Eisteddfod's virtual
            mixed choir and mass band performance. We all recorded our
            contribution and sent our entries to the Eisteddfod organisers. We
            advertised our involvement on our
            <a

              >link to the finished performance</a

            so all could see.
          </p>
          <p>
            Christmas is a time when we usually visit schools, churches,
            community groups, superstores and shopping arcades, care homes,
            local parks etc to play festive music - and everyone loves the
            traditional sound of a brass band at Christmas. It is also our major
            fundraising time, and donations collected usually finance our
            insurance bills for the forthcoming year
          </p>
          <p>
            Not ones to sit back, we have embarked on a project to get back into
            these venues who welcome us each Christmas. We have remote recorded
            our Christmas Carols in our own homes, and have entrusted one of our
            players to merge the music. This has resulted in the completion of a
            DVD that we can donate to those nursing and care homes that we will
            not be allowed to visit this year! The recordings are not digitally
            enhanced, but are a real, natural and traditional sound of
            Christmas. We have never done anything like this before, and have
            been challenged - but we are tremendously proud of the finished
            concert, and all the hard work that went into it. You can watch the
            concert on our
